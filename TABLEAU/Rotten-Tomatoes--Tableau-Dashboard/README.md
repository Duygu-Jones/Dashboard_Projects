## Executive Summary:

Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, I analyzed the Rotten Tomatoes Movies dataset to uncover trends and patterns in movie ratings, genres, and other attributes. 
The analysis identified key factors influencing movie success, such as genre popularity and director impact. 
Based on the findings, several recommendations have been made to leverage these insights for strategic decision-making in the film industry.

### Business Problem:

Understanding movie trends and viewer preferences is crucial for studios and filmmakers to make informed decisions. 
This dataset helps identify popular genres, the impact of different directors on movie ratings, and other factors correlating with movie success. 
How can we use this data to predict future trends and make strategic decisions in the film industry?
