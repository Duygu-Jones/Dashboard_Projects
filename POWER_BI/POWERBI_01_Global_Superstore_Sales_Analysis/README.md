## About the Dataset
The dataset includes sales, order info, customer data, and shipping details. Originally intended for Pentaho DI Kettle, it was perfect for sales simulation training, segmentation, customer analytics, and clustering.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses must understand customer behaviour and product trends to optimize operations and enhance satisfaction. This project aims to answer the following key questions:
1.	What is the number of sales over the past several years?
2.	Which month has the most sales?
3.	Which country has the most sales?
4.	What types of products are ordered the most?
5.	What are the top 5 best-selling products?

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

Used Power BI to clean and transform the data. This process involved organizing disorganized data into a clean format suitable for analysis.
